# Networking Basics

## How computers talk to each other

## Hardware
    * Eithernet
        * Eithernet Card
        * Cable
    * Wifi
        * Wifi Card
        * Wifi Router

## Network : TCP/IP (Transmission Protocol)

| Computer Network | vs | Telephone Network |
|:-- |:--:| -----:|
| Eithernet Card |  | Telephone |
| Cable |  | Cable |
| IP |  | Phone Number |
| Application Protocol: HTTP, SSH |  | Speaking Language: English, Chinese, Japanese |
| Port |  | press '1' For English, '2' for Chinese |

## Software/Application
    * What you can do with others/What your computer can do with other computers
    * Some business/activities  
        * Order / amazon
        * Fun / game

## Application Protocol
* Common Ports/Protocol (Application Protocol)

    | Port | Protocol |
    | -- | -- |
    | 80 | HTTP |
    | 443 | HTTPS |
    | 21 | FTP |
    | 22 | SSH |
    | 23 | TELNET |

* Customized

    | Port | Protocol |
    | -- | -- |
    | 3389 | RDP |
    | 3306 | MySQL |

* **1 IP:Port can only have 1 application listen on it**
This is the common reason why your server or debug does not start.    


# Backend/Frontend
    * Server/Client
    * Server/Browser

## Application may have multiple roles, depends on functionality/business
* Life
    * farm  -> restaurant -> customer
    * farm is Server, <ins>restaurant</ins> is Client
    * <ins>restaurant</ins> is Server, customer is Client

* Internet
    * Amazon -> Citi Bank -> User
    * <ins>Amazon</ins> is Server, User is Client, place order
    * Citi is Server, <ins>Amazon</ins> is Client, verify Payment
