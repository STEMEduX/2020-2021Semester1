Assignment: Create a [Glitch](https://glitch.com) account so you can start coding, modify the hello-express app to be your own. We covered img tags, links and how javascript works in tandem with HTML and CSS in our lass week's class. After you had fun customizing the code. We want you to setup some functional areas for the Presentation Enhancer app we wanted you to create in the weeks prior. To recap, here are the three main areas: 
1. An area to display the transcripted speech
1. An area to display the keywords extracted from the speech transcripts
1. And an area to display image search results using these keywords.

For now, these areas can just be populated with mock text or images that you've choose, in our coming classes, we will make them actually functional.

A few good resources: https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_intro.asp
Youtube and Google resources on html and css.

Assignment: Solution Design on AI Speech2Text and Keyword Extraction Presentation Enhancer.

We are going to design a tool similar to https://www.mmhmm.app/, but with automatic speech2text and Keyword extraction and visual suggestions.

- [x] **Persona/Problem**: Luna is a teacher who teaches English as Second Language (ESL) class to young learners on Zoom. For every class, she needs to design a slideshow to show the words she is teaching. For example, for a class about animals, she has slides on dog, pig, and cow, so she needs to find all the visuals for the slideshow she is designing. It's a fairly manual process to find all these assets to create these slides. It involves a lot of drag and dropping.

- [x] **Solution**: We will create an automatic speech to visual tool, that automatically find relevant visuals as the user speak.

- [x] **User Story**: With this tool, Luna does not need to spend precious time on collecting these visuals. Instead, she just prepare a lesson plan in a document about the topics she'd like to cover, which takes significant less time. At class time, she can just start talking to her class about the topics she'd like to cover, her speech will be transcribed by our tool to text, and the tool will then extract some keywords from the text, as options for starting searches, as she tap these suggested keywords, images or other assets will be automatically found, and then as she select any image from the result, it will be shared to her class because she is sharing only a part of her screen in zoom, with the controlling part (where she select the keywords/visuals) in another screen or on her phone.

- [ ] _Solution Design_:

  - What solution would you create?
  - What's the name of your product? (The most important question! Come up with some catchy name like mmhmm, create a brand, a hook, something that catches people's attention and easy to remember.)
  - Is it a mobile app or browser-based web app?
  - Share some mockups, sketches or even interactive slides or prototypes that demonstrate how the user will be using your tool to accomplish their goals.

- [ ] _Minimum Viable Product (MVP)_: What would your MVP look like? How will you create it. Start building? (next class)
  - Some SpeechRecognition libraries that could be useful (you can find more just by searching `speech recognition api` or `speech recognizer` on Google,
    - Web: https://www.google.com/intl/en/chrome/demos/speech.html
    - iOS: https://github.com/AppDevGuy/OSSSpeechKit
  - Find some Keyword extractor, i.e.: https://www.npmjs.com/package/keyword-extractor
  - Find some web api for searching visual or assets? Google image api? Giphy? Flickr?
